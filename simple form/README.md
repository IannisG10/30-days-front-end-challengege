# Day 2 - Simple Form

## Overview  
For Day 2 of the 30 Days Front-End Challenge, I built a simple and responsive HTML form styled with CSS. This project focuses on layout, form input types, and basic styling techniques.

- Using `flexbox` for form layout  
- Styling inputs and buttons for better UX  
- Adding `:focus` and `:hover` effects
